RXPY is a regular expression library, written purely in Python, that is almost
completely backwards compatible with the standard Python re library (only
locale-based character groups are not supported).

It has a modular design that allows different alphabets and engines to be
used.  This allows regular expressions to be defined over sequences of
arbitrary objects (a mapping between objects and the characters used in the
regular expression must exist; this is defined by the alphabet).

Release 0.1.0 marks a relatively stable architecture and initial engine.
The next release will add a second engine.
